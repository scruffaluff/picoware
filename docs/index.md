# Shell Scripts

Shell Scripts is a collection of POSIX shell and PowerShell utility scripts.
These scripts are designed for my personal usage, but should be easily
installable on any system.

## Scripts

The following table shows the avaible shell scripts. Each script is aviable in
both POSIX shell and PowerShell versions if its functionality applies to both
Unix and Windows systems.
