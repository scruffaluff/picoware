# Scripts

Scripts is a collection of POSIX shell and PowerShell utility scripts. These
scripts are designed for my personal usage, but should be easily installable on
any system.

## Scripts

The following table shows the available scripts. Each script is available in
both POSIX shell and PowerShell versions if its functionality applies to both
Unix and Windows systems.
